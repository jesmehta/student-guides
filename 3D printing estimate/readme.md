#3D Print Estimation Guide

1.	Load STL into FlashPrint
2.	Move, rotate and otherwise generally align the STL file as needed and snap to ground.
3.	For overhangs or undercuts or other unsupported features, use Supports.
4.	To provide supports,
  a.	click on Supports button
    i.	go to Support option
   ii.	select the type of support required (Treelike / Linear)
  iii.	click OK button
OR
   iv.	use Auto Supports
  b.	click Back to get to main screen
5.	Click on the Extruder button and select the correct extruder
6.	Click on the Print button
  a.	Select the correct extruder material (ABS, PLA, etc)
  b.	Select Supports, Raft, Resolution as appropriate
  c.	Select Advanced if needed.
  d.	Click Ok
7.	Save the .gx file
8.	Read off the estimated Time, Filament, Weight, etc.
9.	Save the .gx file into an SD card to load it on the printer.
